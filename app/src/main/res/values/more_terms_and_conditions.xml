        &lt;h1>Terms and conditions&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            These terms and conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;, &quot;Agreement&quot;) are an agreement
            between EQally (&quot;EQally&quot;, "&quot;"us"&quot;", &quot;we&quot; or &quot;our&quot;)
            and you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;). This
            Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the EQally
            mobile application and any of its products or services (collectively, &quot;Mobile
            Application&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;).
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h2>Accounts and membership&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>
            Creating an account in the EQally application is not compulsory.
            However, if you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible
            for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all
            activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection
            with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts
            before you may sign in and use our Services. Providing false contact information
            of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
            notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
            security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any
            damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may
            suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine
            that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
            content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your
            account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We
            may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further
            registration.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h2>Billing and payments&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>
            You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees,
            charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable.
            Some Services are offered on a free demo basis, others require an immediate
            payment or a promotion code. Sensitive and private data exchange between the
            Mobile Application and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication
            channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. If, in our
            judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you
            to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification,
            and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used
            for the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing at
            any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We
            may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per
            household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
            under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
            the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to
            or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or
            billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h2>Accuracy of information&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>
            Occasionally there may be information in the Mobile Application that contains
            typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to availability,
            promotions and offers. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies
            or omissions, and to change or update information or cancel orders if any
            information in the Mobile Application or on any related Service is inaccurate at
            any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).
            We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the
            Mobile Application including, without limitation, pricing information, except as
            required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied in the Mobile
            Application should be taken to indicate that all information in the Mobile
            Application or on any related Service has been modified or updated.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h2>Backups&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>
            We are not responsible for Content residing in the Mobile Application. In no
            event shall we be held liable for any loss of any Content. It is your sole
            responsibility to maintain appropriate backup of your Content. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with absolutely
            no obligation, we may be able to restore some or all of your data that has been
            deleted as of a certain date and time when we may have backed up data for our
            own purposes. We make no guarantee that the data you need will be available.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h2>Links to other mobile applications&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>
            Although this Mobile Application may link to other mobile applications, we are
            not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship,

            stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not
            warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their
            mobile applications. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the
            actions, products, services, and content of any other third-parties. You should
            carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any mobile
            application, which you access through a link from this Mobile Application. Your
